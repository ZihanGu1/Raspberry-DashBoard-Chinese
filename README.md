# Raspberry-DashBoard-Chinese
The project comes from the open source project of the raspberry pie laboratory, Github address:
https://github.com/spoonysonny/pi-dashboard
Because of the inconvenient use of Chinese users, I have made a Sinicization of it. Foreign users can access the links above and download the English version for use.
This Sinicization version is carried out using unattended robots, and there may be some translation errors. If you find it, please contact me.
When a new version of the English version is released, we will be sinicization and uploaded in time.
Thank the original author for providing us with such a good dashboard to look at the state of the raspberry pie.
